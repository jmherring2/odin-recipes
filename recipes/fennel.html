        <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>This recipe is incredibly easy, and your kids would probably love to help you make it! I let my littles help grate the cheese and measure the noodles.</p>
            <p>For me, mac and cheese has to have a smooth and creamy cheese sauce, and I’ve had enough trial and error in this department to understand that there are a few simple things you can do to achieve that smooth sauce we all want in our macaroni!</p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
         <ul>
             <li>Elbow macaroni</li>
             <li>Butter</li>
             <li>Flour</li>
             <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
             <li>Milk</li>
             <li>Half and half</li>
             <li>Shredded cheddar cheese</li>
         </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
         <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the oven. </strong> Preheat to 325 degrees and lightly grease a square baking dish.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the macaroni.</strong> Slightly undercook your noodles (about 1 minute under al-dente). Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the roux. </strong> Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Blend in the flour, salt, and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Add milk and cheese. </strong> Stir in milk and half and half, slowly, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Add 1 cup shredded cheese to the sauce and stir just until melted. Add the cooked macaroni noodles and toss to coat them in the sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Pour into baking dish. </strong> Pour half or the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle ½ cup cheese over the top. Pour remaining pasta over it and sprinkle with remaining cheese.</li>
        </ol>
